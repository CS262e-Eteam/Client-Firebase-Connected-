# Calvin Market Place

The goal is to create a cross platform marketplace app for Calvin University students. There is currently a Facebook group that allows students to post items they are selling, but there are some major flaws with it: no clear way of indicating if items are still available, listings are ordered by post date so some items get lost, no easy way to filter or search for items (because people post pictures of books), can be difficult to tell the prices of items, and it limits users to those who have Facebook. The initial focus of the app would be for textbooks as that is one of the most common items found on free and for sale and one of the most relevant items to college students. But we hope to be able to expand it to include other items like clothing, technology, etc. The app will allow a user to easily filter and search for items in the marketplace. Once they find an item they are interested in, the app will connect the two users to communicate about purchasing the item (potentially using an in-app chat feature, but for the MVP using email).

We intend to build Calvin Marketplace using Flutter which will allow us to simultaneously develop for Android and iOS. This will allow users using both platforms to buy and sell items increasing the number of items offered. But users will also have the advantage of a more user friendly interface for adding items, viewing items that are being sold, and searching for specific items by a variety of categories.
